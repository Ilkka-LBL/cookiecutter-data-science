# Cookiecutter Data Science

_A logical, reasonably standardized, but flexible project structure for doing and sharing data science work._


#### [Project homepage](http://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/)


### Requirements to use the cookiecutter template:
-----------
 - Python 2.7 or 3.5+
 - [Cookiecutter Python package](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) >= 1.4.0: This can be installed with pip by or conda depending on how you manage your Python packages:

``` bash
$ pip install cookiecutter
```

or

``` bash
$ conda config --add channels conda-forge
$ conda install cookiecutter
```


### To start a new project, run:
------------

    cookiecutter -c v1 https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science

### New version of Cookiecutter Data Science
------------
Cookiecutter data science is moving to v2 soon, which will entail using
the command `ccds ...` rather than `cookiecutter ...`. The cookiecutter command
will continue to work, and this version of the template will still be available.
To use the legacy template, you will need to explicitly use `-c v1` to select it.
Please update any scripts/automation you have to append the `-c v1` option (as above),
which is available now.


### The resulting directory structure
------------

The directory structure of your new project looks like this: 

```

├── README.md          <- The top-level README for developers using this project.
├── .gitignore         <- NEVER DELETE THIS FILE.
├── data
│   ├── downloaded     <- Data from downloads.
│   ├── interim        <- Intermediate data that has been transformed.
│   ├── processed      <- The final, canonical data sets for modeling.
│   └── raw            <- The original, immutable data dump.
│
│
├── models             <- Trained and serialized models, model predictions, or model summaries
│
├── requirements.txt   <- The requirements file for reproducing the analysis environment, e.g.
│                         generated with `pip freeze > requirements.txt
├── .env               <- Environment variables                          
│
├── clean_dataset.py   <- Compilation and reformatting of data to create data files in /data/processed/
│                          
└── analysis.py        <- Analyse data and create final data product based on files in /data/processed/
```
